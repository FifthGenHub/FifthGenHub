# 🤠 Hi, I’m @FifthGenHub

### 🧠 Founder of DexHunt — Skill-Based Web3 Arcade Game  
Reflex duels. Real gameplay. No gambling.  
$DEXHUNT token launched. PixelShop open. NFTs teased. Burn counter live.

### 🎓 Business Background  
Bachelor's in Business Administration (Fall 2025)  
Crypto-native builder with real-world foundation.  
I run DexHunt like a startup — because it is one.

---

### 👾 Building Toward: The Arcadeverse  
My next project, (Name TBD), is a full-on crypto arcade ecosystem:  
- Skill-based Web3 games only  
- Fair-launch tokens  
- Optional dev publishing  
- NFT + shop utility that actually does something

DexHunt is just the beginning — we’re building the arcade the blockchain was missing.

---

### 💡 Interests  
- Web3 gaming (but actually fun)  
- Legal tokenomics (yes, it’s possible)  
- Real community > speculative pumps  
- Reflex over luck. Skill over stake.

### 📚 Currently Learning  
- Solana bot architecture  
- Liquidity pool mechanics  
- On-chain reward systems  
- Why sleep is optional when you’re building the future

---

### 🤝 Let’s Collaborate On:

### ⚡ Fun Fact  
DexHunt was built by a solo founder, full-time dad, and future arcade king.  
No VC. No team. Just grit and a mouse-click speed faster than yours.
